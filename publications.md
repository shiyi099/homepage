## Early Project

- [Dynamic Supplementary Heat System for Blast Furnace Slag](https://newstest.ncst.edu.cn/col/1393558054724/2020/12/28/1609148866922.html)<br><img title="" src="https://shiyi099.github.io/Billion.github.io/images/publications/ChiLunTechnology.png" alt="" data-align="inline">**Yi Shi**, Xinghui Hao<br>

  This is an intelligent manufacturing project at the intersection of artificial intelligence and metallurgy. The goal is to detect high-temperature molten material in the melt pool (with $SiO_2$ used in experiments), and to estimate its volume from the area observed in 2D images. Based on this estimation, the system aims to monitor and calculate the real-time heat compensation required, ultimately contributing to energy conservation and emission reduction.<br>
  <br>
  The following figure displays the pipeline of the system.<br><img title="" src="https://shiyi099.github.io/Billion.github.io/images/publications/ChiLunTechnologyTeaser.jpg" alt="" data-align="inline">
