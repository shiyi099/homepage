# About Me

<img title="" src="https://shiyi099.github.io/homepage/images/Yi Shi.jpg" alt="" class="floatpic">

Here is **Yi Shi (Billion, 石义)**.<br>

I have just achieved my Master's degree in the Department of [Music AI and Music Information Technology](https://www.ccom.edu.cn/jgk/jxdw/ylrgznyylxxkjx.htm) at the [Central Conservatory of Music](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中央音乐学院) in China. My academic interests lie at the intersection of music performance, machine learning, and multimedia technologies.

My recent research focuses on gesture prediction algorithms for bowed string instruments, such as cello and violin, with the aim of improving music education and performance analysis through multimodal learning and interactive systems. I am also exploring topics like spatial audio alignment with camera movement and real-time music generation for audiovisual applications.

With a strong background in both music and technology, I aspire to continue my research in interdisciplinary PhD programs, especially those related to multimodal AI, virtual performance environments, and creative human-computer interaction.If you'd like to connect or chat more about these topics, feel free to reach out: [**shiyi@mail.ccom.edu.cn**](mailto:shiyi@ccom.edu.cn)
